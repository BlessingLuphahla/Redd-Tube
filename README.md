# React + Vite Template

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Plugins

Currently, two official plugins are available for React in Vite:

### 1. [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)

Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.

### 2. [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)

Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start a development server with hot-reloading, and your application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## ESLint Setup

This template includes basic ESLint configuration to ensure code quality and consistency.

To run ESLint, use the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```
